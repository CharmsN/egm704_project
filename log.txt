Project Theme:
Comparative Remote Sensing Methods for Habitat Classification and Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) Applications in the UK Utility Sector

Week 1 – Proposal Development (from 22 Sept)
• Finalised research question, hypothesis, aims, and objectives.
• Drafted “Gap in Knowledge” and initial literature review outline.
• Created Gantt chart for study timeline.
• Identified three review themes: Remote sensing for habitat classification, Drone imagery validation, and BNG/UKHab integration.
• Started building Zotero reference library and reading anchor papers.

Week 2 – Dataset Familiarisation
• Reviewed Sentinel-2 properties (10 m vs 20 m) and hyperspectral vs multispectral differences.
• Investigated Pixxel, PRISMA, and EnMAP for context.
• Identified Desborough AOI for baseline testing.
• Confirmed Sentinel-2 and drone orthomosaic combination for classification validation.

Week 3 – Methodology Design
• Defined workflow comparing NDVI thresholding and Random Forest classification.
• Established ground-truth validation plan using drone orthomosaics.
• Outlined accuracy metrics (confusion matrix, kappa, F1-score).
• Drafted detailed methodology section for proposal (due 22 Oct).

Week 4 – Data Infrastructure & Tools Setup
• Created Python environment egm704_project.
• Installed geospatial libraries: geopandas, shapely, fiona, pyproj, rasterio, sentinelsat.
• Linked Jupyter and VS Code environments.
• Developed Sentinel-2 search script using sentinelsat and SciHub access.
• Configured .netrc authentication for secure credentials storage.

Week 5 – AOI & Data Query Automation
• Created and validated Desborough AOI (desborough_aoi.gpkg).
• Built Python scripts for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 queries.
• Folder hierarchy established:
    egm704_project/
        data_files/
        scripts/sentinel/
        s1_downloads/
• Tested Sentinel-2 download function (download_best_overlap_image).

Week 6 – Sentinel-1 Integration & Workflow Refinement (Today)
• Worked from before 5 a.m. to after 7 p.m. (≈14 hours total, 7–8 focused).
• Began configuring Sentinel-1 retrieval using Copernicus Data Space token (fetch_s1_cdse.py).
• Encountered 403/path errors → switched to SentinelAPI/SciHub method.
• Created secure _netrc file for authentication, excluded from version control.
• Saved/configured new scripts:
    - download_s1_best_overlap.py (for water-company polygons)
    - download_s1_from_aoi.py (for Desborough AOI)
• Installed GeoPandas, Shapely, Fiona, PyProj, Rtree in egm704_project.
• Next: Run download_s1_from_aoi.py to query/download Sentinel-1 data via SciHub using AOI geometry.

Next Steps
• Verify GeoPandas installation.
• Run download_s1_from_aoi.py for Desborough AOI.
• Inspect downloaded SAFE metadata and footprint.
• Integrate Sentinel-1 preprocessing (speckle filter, calibration).
• Compare Sentinel-1 vs Sentinel-2 classification outputs.
